**Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?**
```
I have really learnt a lot from this boot camp that was not taught in cloudera doucmentation. 
As for the labs, it is still manageable.
```

**Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?**
```
Resources was the least familiar and security was the most familiar to me.
```

**Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?**
```
I find that the topic security was most helpful out of the others.
```

**How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?**
```
I think I would need about 1 month to get myself more comfortable in installing a cluster alone.
I need to further improve my knowledge in security.
